# NeoType

Tired of needing to go to a website powered by bloated JavaScript just to do a typing test?

Fear no more, for NeoType is here! It runs in your UNIX terminal and is powered by classic ANSI escape codes!

It's currently quite minimal, partially by design, but I am also not sure what I should add. Open an issue if you have any feature requests!

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tteeoo/neotype
$ cd neotype
$ install -d share ~/.local/share/neotype
$ go build
# cp neotype /usr/local/bin/
```

Note: The above commands will compile NeoType, but a pre-compiled binary (Linux x86-64) is also provided on the latest GitHub release.

## Usage

Just run `neotype` to start, optionally provide a number of words: `neotype --words x`.

NeoType looks for the data directory at the following paths:

```
$NEOTYPE_DATA
$XDG_DATA_HOME/neotype
$HOME/.local/share/neotype
```

## License

The glorious Unlicense!

In other words, this software is dedicated to the public domain.
